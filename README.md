This is a tee time booking application that is being built with Next.js. It allows golfers to easily book tee times, submit reviews for golf courses, and explore options all in one place. Golf course owners can also manage their tee times, ensuring a smooth and organized experience for everyone. 

The backend currently utilizes PostgreSQL and the Prisma ORM for smooth database operations as well as JWT authentication for secure log-ins and role based access.
